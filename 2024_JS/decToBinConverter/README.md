Learn Recursion by building a decimal to binary converter:

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.

In this project, you’ll build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. You’ll learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.

~NOTES~
Your code logic is mostly correct, but there might be some contextual issues depending on how the result and input variables are defined or used in your JavaScript code. Here’s a breakdown to troubleshoot the issue:
	1.	Variable Definition:
	•	Ensure result is correctly defined and references the element you want to modify. For example:

const result = document.getElementById("result"); // Or any appropriate selector


	•	Ensure input is defined and has a value that you expect.

	2.	Type Checking:
	•	If input is a string, comparing it directly to 0 (a number) won’t work. Use === only if you’re certain both are the same type.
	•	Otherwise, ensure input is converted to a number if needed:

if (Number(input) === 0) {
    result.innerText = "0";
    return;
}


	3.	Order of Operations:
	•	The statement return result.innerText = "0"; works but is unconventional. The return keyword should generally not include an assignment for readability and debugging clarity. It might also not behave as expected depending on the broader context.
	•	Instead, do the assignment and return separately:

if (input === 0) {
    result.innerText = "0";
    return;
}


	4.	Additional Context:
	•	Check if the function containing this if statement is being called correctly.
	•	Ensure result exists in the DOM before this line of code runs.

Final Version

A cleaner and more robust version of your code:

function updateResult(input) {
    const result = document.getElementById("result"); // Ensure result exists
    if (!result) {
        console.error("Result element not found");
        return;
    }
    if (Number(input) === 0) {
        result.innerText = "0";
        return;
    }
    // Other code logic if input is not 0
}
